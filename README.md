# SwarmSim

**Simulate 2D and 3D swarms of mobile agents** with various dynamics and implement **distributed control laws** to obtain different behaviours.

To execute your first simulation simply run `Launcher.m`.

## Features
  - Simulation of swarms of mobile agents (see `Launcher.m`).
  - Implement your own dynamical model or use one of the embedded ones (see `integrateAgents.m`).
  - Implement your own distributed control law or use one of the default ones (see `globalInteractionForce.m`).
  - Acquisition of metrics to evaluate the performance.
  - Extensive simulations to study stochastic effects or different initial conditions (see `MultiLauncher.m`).
  - Extensive simulations to study the effects of the parameters (see `SequentialLauncher.m`).
  - Simulate swarms of photo-sensistive microorganisms (see `LauncherMicroorg.m`)
  - Analize [DOME](https://theopendome.org/) experiments, generate digital twins on microorganisms and run virtual experiments (see `DOME` folder) 
  - Local stability analysis of lattice configurations via linearization (see `CrystalStability.m`).
  - Interface with Robotarium code to perform advanced simulations and real life experiments (see `RobotariumSimulator.m`). 
    For more details refer to https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu.
  - Plots to visualise the simulation and the metrics.
  - Automatic save the results of the simulations.

## External resources
The [DOME](https://theopendome.org/) is an open-source platform for the control of microscale agents using light. 
To use the DOME, perform experiments and analyze the resulting data use [DOME-software](https://github.com/andreagiusti96/DOME-software).

The [Robotarium](https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu) allows to remotely conduct real-life swarm robotics experiments.
